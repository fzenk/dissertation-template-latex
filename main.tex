\noindent In linguistic examples with interlinear glossing, personal pronouns are represented with a number followed by one or more letters. For instance, ``1S'' marks a 1st person singular pronoun and ``3MS'' marks a 3rd person masculine singular pronoun. Complementizers are abbreviated to ``COMP'' in interlinear glosses and to ``C'' in syntactic trees. Hebrew Academy romanization is used to transcribe Hebrew sentences, Yale romanization is used to transcribe Korean sentences, and pinyin romanization is used to transcribe Mandarin sentences. Ungrammatical sentences are marked with asterisks.
